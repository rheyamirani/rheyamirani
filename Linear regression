What does the model achieve?
- Derives a linear correlation between Blood pressure and Age for the given set of patients (young-middle aged).

How should metrics be interpreted?
- Slope (its intercept) is the relationship between Blood pressure and Age for the given set of patients (young-middle aged).

What are appropriate use cases?
- This graph can be used to check the correlation between Blood pressure and Age with the expectation that the relationship is linear

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- The sample size of patients is just six which is very small. More observations need to be made to accurately predict its use.
- There might be cases where patients in the age group of 25-50 show low blood pressure reading instead of high.
- Also old aged patients and patients below 25 years of need to be considered for this study to make good use of it.

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
- Blood pressure is heavily correlated with Age. There is a need to gather more data to ensure that the relationship is linear.
